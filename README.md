## 🎯 About me

I'm a developer who believes **code is for humans first, machines second**. My philosophy is simple:
1. **Make it work** — solve the problem  
2. **Make it robust** — refactor for resilience  
3. **Make it beautiful** — polish for readability and maintainability

I'm equally comfortable on frontend and backend, and I adapt quickly to new challenges. Currently focused on shipping solid projects and graduating from USI, with eyes on a role where I can grow as a full-stack developer.

## 🚀 Featured achievement

**SEWorld** — Rewrote & refactored a project from scratch  
Repo: [simo-macca/SEWorld](https://github.com/simo-macca/SEWorld) (work in progress)

What made this special:
- Inherited a large codebase built by 12+ people across multiple teams
- Analyzed the architecture, identified bottlenecks and design issues
- **Completely rewrote the project** with a focus on: cleaner architecture, improved performance, better code organization, and maintainability
- Result: more fluid, resilient, and robust system — easier for the team to understand and extend

This project is my best demonstration of:
- Full-stack thinking (frontend + backend harmoniously integrated)
- Architectural refactoring and code smell elimination
- Attention to developer experience and code readability
